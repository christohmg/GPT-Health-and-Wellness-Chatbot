# GPT-Health-and-Wellness-Chatbot
For my Machine Learning in Natural Language capstone project, I worked alongside a small team to develop a chatbot specializing in health and personalized nutrition plans using LLMs. The project involved leveraging LLMs to analyze medical research, nutritional data, and fitness guides to offer customized diet plans, workout routines, and wellness tips based on individual user preferences, health conditions, and goals. I fine-tuned a GPT model to enhance the chatbot's focus on wellness and mental health. Additionally, I conducted an online search to identify 15 websites providing related services and advice, storing the names and descriptions in a JSON file, and used cosine similarity to present the most relevant website to users.
